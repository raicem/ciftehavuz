This is a simple guide to show how to install and configure the [Impulse Blocker Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/impulse-blocker/). 

You can install the extension from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/impulse-blocker/) like any other Firefox extension. In order to add the websites you want to block follow these steps.

After installing the extension, open the extension manager from the menu.

In this page, you can add whatever website you want the block by input box. You can omit the http:// as the extension handles it. You can also omit .com as the extension will add it as a default. Also if you add example.com, www.example.com will also be blocked, so you don't have to repeat domains.

After listing the domains you don't want to visit, you can enjoy browsing. You can turn the extension on or off by the toolbar icon. Also you add websites to block right from this menu.
