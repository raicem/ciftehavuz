Some people love their debugger and some people don't even feel the need when they can just var_dump whatever value they have. It's easy, quick, and development environment independent. 

- How debugger works (ports, connection and else)
- explain DBGP
- Methods of debugging
- Initiating debug session
- Show what breakpoint actually does
- Conclude with gibing our extension

Setting up the Xdebug might be a challenging task but I believe that comes from not really understanding how the remote debugging works and trying to setup your debugger by blindly following a manual or a blog post. That does not help when development environment setups are different you face a unique error. Therefore, I'll first try to explain how a remote debugger works. 

One would think that remote debugging means that you are debugging the code away from your local development environment. That is not the case most of the time. Remote debugging is named that way because script you want to debug is executed by your local server and not by the tool you are using for debug. 

So even though you run a local server on your development environment and connecting that to server to do debugging, you are doing a remote debugging.
