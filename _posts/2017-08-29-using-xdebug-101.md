Some people love their debugger and some people don't even feel the need when they can just var_dump whatever value they have. It's easy, quick IDE and development environment independent. And whole setup of debugger does not help. 

- How debugger works (ports, connection and else)
- explain DBGP
- Methods of debugging
- Initiating debug session
- Show what breakpoint actually does
- Conclude with gibing our extension
