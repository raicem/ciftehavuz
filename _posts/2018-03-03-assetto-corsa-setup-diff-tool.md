Ever wanted to compare two Assetto Corsa side by side? Well, I have and I could not found any simple solutions.
So I've hacked a simple script and a web page that will allow you to compare two setups side by side. You will immediately see which setup has which values higher or lower.
The setups are not uploaded anywhere. All of the calculations are made in the browser. So you don't have to worry about sharing your private setups. You can use the tool even if you are disonnected (once you load the webpage of course).

Here is the [link](https://raicem.github.io/assetto-diff-tool).
